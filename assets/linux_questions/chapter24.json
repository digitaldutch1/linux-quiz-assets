                    "question": "Peter's system has a memory-intensive application running on it continually. To help improve performance, he has replaced the old hard drives with solid-state drives instead of increasing RAM. Which of the following is most likely true about this situation?",
                    "options": ["The SSD for application data will enter a degraded mode.", "The SSD for swap will become degraded storage.", "The SSD will need a namespace in its device filename.", "The SSD will end up a missing volume.", "The SSD will experience resource exhaustion."],

                        "The SSD will end up a missing volume.": "This is incorrect; a missing volume occurs with logical volumes.",
                        "The SSD will experience resource exhaustion.": "This may happen, but the information provided is not sufficient."
