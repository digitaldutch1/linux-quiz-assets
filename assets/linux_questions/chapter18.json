                    "explanation": {
                        "They use ACLs for allowing packets.": "This is correct; firewalls use access control lists to identify allowed packets.",
                        "They detect malicious behavior.": "This is incorrect; firewalls do not detect malicious behavior.",
                        "They inspect network packet control information.": "This is correct; they inspect packet headers.",
                        "They use iptables embedded in the Linux kernel.": "This is incorrect; they use netfilter, which is embedded in the kernel.",
                        "They employ configuration files for persistency.": "This is correct; configuration files allow settings to survive reboots."
